This is the README file for the SJSU (IBM Cohort2) CmpE275 
Project 2 project, AKA "Reach Out".

Reach Out is an exercise in designing and implementing a set of
social "communities" on a fully distributed base.  That is, the
system has no centralized servers or points of control, and 
community services can be added and removed dynamically.
